CODAP
=====
Common Online Data Analysis Platform
------------------------------------
### A Bit of History

Development of this codebase began in 2010 as part of the work of KCP Technologies' NSF-supported [Data Games](http://play.ccssgames.com/) project. In a data game, the data generated by playing the game flows into CODAP for analysis and visualization. In a well-designed data game, the player cannot progress very far without using the data to inform and refine a strategy.

Starting in 2012 CODAP became the data analysis environment for [Concord Consortium](https://concord.org/)'s NSF-supported [InquirySpace](http://concord.org/projects/inquiryspace) project. Developed to promote scientific inquiry in high school science classes, students work with simulations or gather data with probes. The data flow into CODAP for analysis, facilitating hypothesis generation and iteration of experiments.

In April, 2014, CODAP received NSF funding as a [project in its own right](https://concord.org/projects/codap) with the goal of developing a platform that can be used by developers of online curriculum materials that engage learners with data. Initial collaborations are: continuing work with InquirySpace and new work with [OceanTracks](http://oceantracks.org) at [EDC](http://www.edc.org) and [Terra Populus](http://www.terrapop.org) at the [Minnesota Population Center](https://www.pop.umn.edu/index.php). CODAP's success depends on the extent to which a community of developers embraces it as a way to bring dynamic, interactive data science tools to classroom (and other) learning. This work resulted in CODAP Version 2 which, by 2022 was being used by ~40K unique "28-day-active-users" in over 70 countries (stats from Google Analytics).

July 2022 saw the beginning of the development of CODAP Version 3, a complete reimplementation of CODAP using modern web development tools such as React, Typescript, MobX State Tree and D3. The goal of version 3 is that while the underlying software is completely new, the application features and user interface are largely unchanged so that users' transition to version 3 is as seamless as possible.

### What CODAP Looks Like

What CODAP looks like will depend strongly on the context. But below is a screen shot of CODAP in use with an InquirySpace investigation. The **Terminal Velocity** component is a simulation that is streaming data to CODAP. Note the hierarchical structure of the data in which there are five runs, each containing a time series. Note also the linked selection in which the fourth run and its time series are selected.

# Developer instructions

### Initial steps

1. Clone this repo and `cd` into it
2. Run `npm install` to pull dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to run `webpack-dev-server` in development mode with hot module replacement

#### Run using HTTPS

Additional steps are required to run using HTTPS.

1. install [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) : `brew install mkcert` (install using Scoop or Chocolatey on Windows)
2. Create and install the trusted CA in keychain if it doesn't already exist:   `mkcert -install`
3. Ensure you have a `.localhost-ssl` certificate directory in your home directory (create if needed, typically `C:\Users\UserName` on Windows) and cd into that directory
4. Make the cert files: `mkcert -cert-file localhost.pem -key-file localhost.key localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1`
5. Run `npm run start:secure` to run `webpack-dev-server` in development mode with hot module replacement

Alternately, you can run secure without certificates in Chrome:
1. Enter `chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost` in Chrome URL bar
2. Change flag from disabled to enabled
3. Run `npm run start:secure:no-certs` to run `webpack-dev-server` in development mode with hot module replacement

### Building

If you want to build a local version run `npm build`, it will create the files in the `dist` folder.
You *do not* need to build to deploy the code, that is automatic.  See more info in the Deployment section below.

### Notes

1. Make sure if you are using Visual Studio Code that you use the workspace version of TypeScript.
   To ensure that you are open a TypeScript file in VSC and then click on the version number next to
   `TypeScript React` in the status bar and select 'Use Workspace Version' in the popup menu.

## Deployment

Follow the instructions in this
[Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EacCSUhaHXaL8ll8xjcd4svyguEO-ipf5aF980-_q8E)
to setup an S3 & Cloudfront distribution that can be used with Github actions.
See also `s3_deploy.sh`, and `./github/ci.yml`.

Production releases to S3 are based on the contents of the /dist folder and are built automatically by GitHub Actions
for each branch pushed to GitHub and each merge into production.

Merges into production are deployed to http://starter-projects.concord.org.

Other branches are deployed to http://starter-projects.concord.org/branch/<name>.

To deploy a production release:

1. Increment version number in package.json
2. Create new entry in CHANGELOG.md
3. Run `git log --pretty=oneline --reverse <last release tag>...HEAD | grep '#' | grep -v Merge` and add contents (after edits if needed to CHANGELOG.md)
4. Run `npm run build`
5. Copy asset size markdown table from previous release and change sizes to match new sizes in `dist`
6. Create `release-<version>` branch and commit changes, push to GitHub, create PR and merge
7. Checkout master and pull
8. Checkout production
9. Run `git merge master --no-ff`
10. Push production to GitHub
11. Use https://github.com/concord-consortium/starter-projects/releases to create a new release tag

### Testing

Run `npm test` to run jest tests. Run `npm run test:full` to run jest and Cypress tests.

##### Cypress Run Options

Inside of your `package.json` file:
1. `--browser browser-name`: define browser for running tests
2. `--group group-name`: assign a group name for tests running
3. `--spec`: define the spec files to run
4. `--headed`: show cypress test runner GUI while running test (will exit by default when done)
5. `--no-exit`: keep cypress test runner GUI open when done running
6. `--record`: decide whether or not tests will have video recordings
7. `--key`: specify your secret record key
8. `--reporter`: specify a mocha reporter

##### Cypress Run Examples

1. `cypress run --browser chrome` will run cypress in a chrome browser
2. `cypress run --headed --no-exit` will open cypress test runner when tests begin to run, and it will remain open when tests are finished running.
3. `cypress run --spec 'cypress/integration/examples/smoke-test.js'` will point to a smoke-test file rather than running all of the test files for a project.
